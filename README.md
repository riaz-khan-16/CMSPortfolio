# CMS_By_Django
Project's Title: CMS Development By DJango,SQLite and JQuery.
Project Description:

What the application does:
The website is made for showing a person's skills, experiences, educational histrory, previous and presend projects, services, contact information etc.
The project contains a resposive portfolio landing page where
intro, educational experiences, skills,
professional experiences, and personal project can be 
express in a smart way. The contents can be managed by the website owner easily through multiple dashboard.
The content can be added, updated or deleted quickly.
So that the user can be up to date.

What technologies are used:
Design: html, css, Bootstrap
Front-end: JQuery, Raw JS
Backend: Django
Database: SQLITE

Why I used the technologies:
The backend part of the website is built in by python's Django Framework which
maintain MVT flow. Django is a free, python-based, open-source web development framework that facilitates clean and rational designing of websites driven by databases.
It reduces a lot of hassles that a developer has to face during the development of a website. It is used to develop minimal yet smart web applications.

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

Reading and writing operations are very fast for SQLite database. It is almost 35% faster than File system. It only loads the data which is needed, rather than reading the entire file and hold it in memory. If you edit small parts, it only overwrite the parts of the file which was changed.

Challenges I faced:
  I faced implenting image uploading, editing features with SQLite database. But I found it very easy after learning.
